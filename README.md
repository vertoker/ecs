## Yet Another ECS

Required C++ 20

My first ECS implementation, may be not enough stable, because I can add random shit like experimental functionalily or broke or remade some stable API. Use my your own risk. Any suggestions are welcome!

TODO
- add tests
- add multithreading support
- refactor this to the library for CMake
